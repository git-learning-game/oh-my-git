#: DESCRIPTION
msgid ""
"So you have decided to apply for time travel school, to learn how to use "
"this time machine called 'Git'!\n"
"\n"
"How exciting!\n"
"\n"
"You're almost done with the paperwork! You just need to fill in one more "
"reason why you want to learn Git."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This time, you're making a lot of backup copies - you can look at them by "
"clicking on them!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You've been accepted to time travel school! Yay! It's your first day! Your "
"teacher explains:\n"
"\n"
"'To do anything with a time machine, you first need to initialize it!'\n"
"\n"
"Drag that blue card up to play it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These playing cards are designed to be easy to use and to remember! We'd "
"suggest sticking to them if you don't have a lot of experience with Git!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use your time machine to make snapshots of objects around you! Here, "
"let's practice this!\n"
"\n"
"(Your teacher pours some water into a glass.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's add your name to our list of students!\n"
"\n"
"I already have a second commit of it in my time machine - let's work "
"together!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first day at Time Travel School comes to an end and you receive the key "
"to your room.\n"
"Full of excitement you open the door just to find... spider webs! Spider "
"webs everywhere!\n"
"\n"
"Remove all the spider webs you can find with the remove card!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that your room looks tidy, you can start to unpack your stuff. You "
"brought two new pieces of furniture with you and with a bright smile,\n"
"you see that their colors match the color of your bed!\n"
"\n"
"Build up your two pieces of furniture by playing the touch card.\n"
"Then name your furniture - you can choose whatever you like.\n"
"\n"
"Make sure the colors match! You can find the bed's color in its "
"description.\n"
"Don't forget to add a color and description to your new furnitures, too!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The yellow boxes are frozen points in time, we call them 'commits'! You can "
"travel between them using the 'checkout' card! (Try it!)\n"
"\n"
"Can you find out what happened here? Then, while on the last commit, edit "
"the files to fix the problem, and make a new commit!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Did you know that creating parallel timelines is perfectly legal and safe? "
"It's true!\n"
"\n"
"Can you find out when things went wrong in this zoo? Then, go back to the "
"last good commit and create a parallel universe where everyone is happy!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You were invited to two parties! At one of them, your favorite band is "
"playing - and the other one is your best friend's birthday party. Where "
"should you go? No worries - as a time travel agent in training, you can go "
"to both parties!\n"
"\n"
"To make it easier to tell which timeline is which, you can create time "
"portals! (We call these 'branches'.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that there are two options to 'travel to the end of a timeline':\n"
"\n"
"First, you can directly travel to the commit, like we've done it before.\n"
"\n"
"And second, you can travel to the branch label. In this case, when you make "
"a new commit, the branch will grow with you, and still point at the end of "
"the timeline!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Life is full of dangers, right? Even when walking to school, it seems like "
"there's a lot of risks!\n"
"\n"
"This Monday is especially bad. You made it to school, but there's some "
"timelines you definitely don't want to keep around."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of your colleagues messed up here, and put the branches in the wrong "
"timelines!\n"
"\n"
"You could delete and re-create these branches - but you can also directly "
"move them to different commits, by using\n"
"\n"
"    git checkout\n"
"\n"
"on the branch names, and then using\n"
"\n"
"    git reset --hard\n"
"\n"
"on the commit where you want the branch to be.\n"
"\n"
"The donut branch is in the right place, but the timeline is still incomplete "
"- make you actually *eat* the donut in that branch!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's a trick so that you can sleep a bit longer: just do all your morning "
"activities in parallel universes, and then at the end, merge them together!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, timelines will contradict each other.\n"
"\n"
"For example, in this case, one of our clients wants these timelines merged, "
"but they ate different things for breakfast in both timelines.\n"
"\n"
"Try to merge them together! You'll notice that there will be a conflict! The "
"time machine will leave it up to you how to proceed: you can edit the "
"problematic item, it will show you the conflicting sections. You can keep "
"either of the two versions - or create a combination of them! Remove the "
">>>, <<<, and === markers, and make a new commit to finalize the merge!\n"
"\n"
"Let your finalized timeline be the 'main' one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Welcome to today's lesson! We're going to learn how to make commits with "
"more precision!\n"
"\n"
"Have a look at these two timelines. They have exactly the same outcome. But "
"one of them makes it much easier to figure out what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So far, when we made a commit, we've always recorded the current status of "
"all objects, right?\n"
"\n"
"But Git allows you to pick which changes you want to put in a commit!\n"
"\n"
"To learn how that works, we need to learn about the 'index'! In the index, "
"we can prepare what will be in the next commit. In this game, the index is "
"represented by a blue aura around icons in the file browser!\n"
"\n"
"Initially, the index is empty. To make a commit that contains a new file, we "
"need to add it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When we change files, the index won't change on its own. We have to use `git "
"add` to update the index to the changed version of the file.\n"
"\n"
"Let's try that!\n"
"\n"
"The icons in the file browser show you when the actual file (white) and the "
"version in the index (blue) are different, and when they are the same!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the dark shadow behind the icons? That's the version of the file in the "
"last commit!\n"
"\n"
"For example, these candles have been blown out, and that change has been "
"added.\n"
"\n"
"But you decide that this was a mistake! You only want to blow out the red "
"candle in the next commit!\n"
"\n"
"If you already have updated the index to a changed file, but want to reset "
"it, you can use `git reset`!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The index is really useful, because it allows us to be precise about which "
"changes we want to include in each commit!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your friend added another line to your essay! Get it, add a third one and "
"send it to them!\n"
"\n"
"Take turns until you have five lines!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both you and your friend have been working on the file, and want to sync up!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Okay - turns out that saving time in the morning by utilizing parallel "
"universes is against the regulations of the International Time Travel "
"Association. You'll have to do your tasks in sequence after all.\n"
"\n"
"See the 'rebase' card? When you drag it to a commit, it will copy the events "
"in your current timeline after the specified one! This way, make a clean, "
"linear timeline where you visit all three shops.\n"
"\n"
"Again, we want to make that our base reality - the 'main' branch should "
"point to that timeline!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Oops, looks like there's something messed up here. Can you put the events "
"back into their correct order?\n"
"\n"
"There are two ways to do this: You can drag the 'interactive rebase' card to "
"the commit before the one you want to change, then reorder the lines in the "
"file that opens, and save it.\n"
"\n"
"Or you can reset the main tag to the very first commit, and then cherry-pick "
"single commits in the order you want. You have cards for both approaches!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Oops - you deleted the 'essay' file, which you worked on all night!\n"
"\n"
"Luckily, Git is here to help! You can use `git checkout` to restore the file!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's a similar problem: you really liked the essay from the very first "
"commit, and want to have it back! Well, checkout can also restore things "
"from older commits, Here's how:\n"
"\n"
"    git checkout [commit] [file]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Oh no, we made a bad commit! How can we undo making the commit, and go back "
"to a point where we can try again?\n"
"\n"
"The answer is using `git reset [commit]`, which does two things:\n"
"\n"
"- It resets the current branch ref to the commit you specify.\n"
"- And it resets the index to that commit.\n"
"\n"
"It does not change your working directory in any way, which means that after "
"that, you can try making the commit you want again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We were talking about how to undo a commit, and fix it. This only helps when "
"you haven't already pushed it to a remote. When that has happened, and you "
"want to undo the effects of the commit completely, your best option is `git "
"revert`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Say you were looking at something in the past, and then switched back to the "
"main branch.\n"
"\n"
"But then, you got reaaally distracted, and after your lunch break, you can't "
"remember on which commit in the past you were before. How can you find out?\n"
"\n"
"There's a convenient command that shows you all the places your HEAD did "
"point to in the past:\n"
"\n"
"    git reflog"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your friend has a problem! Clone the repo, create a branch called "
"'solution', and fix the problem in this branch. When you're ready, make a "
"'Pull Request' by using `git tag pr`."

msgid ""
"(Please zoom out a bit using your mouse wheel! :D)\n"
"\n"
"Oh no! You have lost your key at some point during the day!\n"
"\n"
"Sure, you could look at every single commit in an attempt to find it - but "
"there's a better way: your time machine has a built-in way to find the point "
"in time where things went wrong quickly!\n"
"\n"
"First, play the 'bisect start' card. Then, go to a commit where you don't "
"have the key, and play the 'bisect bad' card. Likewise, go to a commit early "
"on where you have the key *in your pocket*, and play the 'bisect good "
"card'.\n"
"\n"
"After you've found the last good commit, reset the main branch to it. What "
"happened to the key after you lost it?"
