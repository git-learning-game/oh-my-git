rebase_description_254,"Okay - turns out that saving time in the morning by utilizing parallel universes is against the regulations of the International Time Travel Association. You'll have to do your tasks in sequence after all.

See the ""rebase"" card? When you drag it to a commit, it will copy the events in your current timeline after the specified one! This way, make a clean, linear timeline where you visit all three shops.

Again, we want to make that our base reality - the ""main"" branch should point to that timeline!",

There are two ways to do this: You can drag the ""interactive rebase"" card to the commit before the one you want to change, then reorder the lines in the file that opens, and save it.

Or you can reset the main tag to the very first commit, and then cherry-pick single commits in the order you want. You have cards for both approaches!",

Sure, you could look at every single commit in an attempt to find it - but there's a better way: your time machine has a built-in way to find the point in time where things went wrong quickly!

First, play the ""bisect start"" card. Then, go to a commit where you don't have the key, and play the ""bisect bad"" card. Likewise, go to a commit early on where you have the key *in your pocket*, and play the ""bisect good"" card.

indexupdate_description_275,"Instead of removing an entry from the index and adding one with the same name, you can also directly update that entry!

Make a commit from the tree in this repository!",
treeread_description_279,"As soon as you have some tree objects, you can always read them and set the index exactly to their content! Unsurprisingly, the command is called

blobremove_congrats_284,"Generally, `git prune` will be useful if you want to clean up some objects you made.

Alternatively, you can also click the ""Reload"" button to restart a level.",
symrefcreate_description_285,"Instead of pointing directly to objects, refs can also point to other refs!

Create a symbolic ref called ""refs/rainbow""!",
commitparents_description_286,"When using the commit-tree command, you can optionally specify a parent:

Make a string of three commits!

Hint: You'll need a tree object. What could be the easiest way to obtain one?",
blobcreate_description_287,"At its core, Git is very simple. It stores ""objects"", which are basically files identified by an ""identifier"" (short: ID).

There are four types of objects: blobs, trees, commits, and tags. The simplest type is a ""blob"", which is just a piece of text.

Let's create some blobs! To do that, create a file with the desired content, and then use

    git hash-object -w <file>

The flag -w means ""write"", and tells Git to actually write the new blob to the disk.

Create three new blobs!",
blobcreate_congrats_288,"Tip: You can also use a command like this to create a blob in a single line:

    echo ""awesome content"" | git hash-object -w --stdin

Did you already notice that you can drag and drop all objects? :)",
treecreate_description_289,"After carefully building the index we want, it would be nice to save a permanent snapshot of it, right?

This is what the second type of objects is for: trees! You can convert the index into a tree using

    git write-tree

Try it! :)",
treecreate_congrats_290,"Nice!

Can you make a different tree? Modify the index, then call `git write-tree` again!",
welcome_description_291,"This is prototype #1 for the Git learning game by @bleeptrack and @blinry. Thanks for checking it out! <3

You can interact with the repository labelled ""yours"" by typing Bash commands in the terminal below! The visualization will show you its internal status.

Let's get started by initializing an empty Git repository in the current directory by typing:

    git init",
welcome_congrats_292,"Well done!

An empty Git repository is... well, quite empty. The only thing that always exists is a reference called ""HEAD"" - we'll learn what that is later!

But first, let's look at some basics!

(Click ""Next Level"" as soon as you're ready!)",
basics_description_293,"For this prototype, we assume you have some experience with the command line. Here are some commands that will be useful:

- ls

- cat file
- mkdir dir

basics_congrats_294,"Omnomnom!

For technical reasons, you can't use `cd` in this prototype yet. But there won't be a lot of interaction with the file system anyways. :)",
puzzlepreciousblob_description_295,Create two trees pointing to the same blob!,
indexadd_description_296,"Blobs usually represent the content of a file. But on their own, they don't have any metadata, not even a name!

Git has a very powerful concept to store metadata related to blobs: the index! It's a list that relates blobs to filenames and access permissions.

The most convenient option to add an entry to the index is via an existing file:

    echo ""my content"" > file
    git update-index --add file

Add three entries to the index! For a bonus challenge: can you add a file that is inside of a directory, like ""directory/file""?",
indexadd_congrats_297,"There's another way to add an entry to the index directly:

    git update-index --add --cacheinfo <mode>,<blobhash>,<name>

The first three numbers of the mode describe the type of the entry, ""100"" is a regular file.

The second three number describe the permissions. Only ""644"" (non-executable) and ""755"" (executable) are supported.

You can insert the hash of an object into the terminal by right-clicking on it! :)",

symrefnoderef_description_301,"When you have a symbolic ref (a ref pointing at another ref), and you decide you want it to be a regular ref again (pointing to an object), you're in for some trouble! :)

What happens when you try pointing the symbolic ref directly to the blob using `git update-ref`?

Oops! Turns out that when you reference a symbolic ref, it acts as if you had specified the ref it points to. To de-symbolic-ize it, use the `--no-deref` option directly after `update-ref`!

Weird, huh?",
symrefnoderef_congrats_302,"Whew, we've covered a lot of things: Blobs! The index! Trees! Commits! Refs!

You now know about almost everything about how Git repositories look like on the inside! We think that's pretty cool! :)

Everything else is just convention and high-level commands that make interacting with the objects more convenient.

We haven't covered:

- tag objects (they are the fourth object type - a bit like refs with a description and an author)
- configuration (allows you to specify remote repositories, for example)
- working with local files (which is, uh, arguably pretty important :P)

refcreate_description_305,"Let's take a look at ""refs"" (short for ""references"")! Refs are not objects, but rather very simple *pointers* to objects! They can help you keep track of what's where.

You can create or update a ref with

    git update-ref refs/<refname> <newvalue>

Make sure to always start a ref's name with ""refs/""! That's a convention that helps Git find all refs you create. If you forget the ""refs/"", you will not see the ref.
