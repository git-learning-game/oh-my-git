[description]

Let's work together with others! Your friend has their own repo at the URL `../friend` - you can add it using

    git remote add [name] [URL]

where `[name]` is an arbitrary, short name you pick for the remote.

When you've done that, you can get all commits from that remote using

    git pull friend

There's a letter for you!

[setup]

git remote remove friend

[setup friend]

echo "I'm really committed to our friendship! <3" > love_letter
git add .
git commit -m "Write a letter"

[win]

# Add a remote that points to ../friend.
git remote -v | grep '../friend'
# Pull from the remote.
git show HEAD:love_letter | grep committed
