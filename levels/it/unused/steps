[description]

Sometimes, you might want to record the order in which things changed, instead of making a single commit.

What happened here? Make two commits from the changes (using the "add" card), in an order that makes sense!

[setup]

echo something > file1
echo something else > file2
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo this should happen first >> file1
echo and this should happen after that >> file2

[win]

test "$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r main)" = "M	file2" &&
test "$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r main^)" = "M	file1"
