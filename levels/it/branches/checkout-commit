[description]

The yellow boxes are frozen points in time, we call them "commits"! You can travel between them using the "checkout" card! (Try it!)

Can you find out what happened here? Then, while on the last commit, edit the files to fix the problem, and make a new commit!

[cli]

To checkout a specific commit, type `git checkout`, then a space, and then right click on the commit you want!

This will insert the commit's unique identifier!

[setup]

echo "This piggy bank belongs to the big sister.
It contains 10 coins." > piggy_bank
git add .
git commit -m "The beginning"

echo "A young girl with brown, curly hair." > little_sister
git add .
git commit -m "Little sister comes in"

echo "Has 10 coins." >> little_sister
echo "This piggy bank belongs to the big sister.
It is empty." > piggy_bank
git add .
git commit -m "Little sister does something"

git checkout HEAD^^
git branch -df main

[win]

# Restore sisterly peace.
{ git show HEAD:piggy_bank | grep "10 coins"; } && { git show HEAD:little_sister | grep -v "10 coins"; } && { git rev-parse HEAD^^^; }

[congrats]

Wonderful! Now that you're getting familiar with the time machine, let's look at some more complicated situations...
