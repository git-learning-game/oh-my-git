At its core, Git is very simple. It stores "objects", which are basically files identified by an "identifier" (short: ID).

There are four types of objects: blobs, trees, commits, and tags. The simplest type is a "blob", which is just a piece of text.

Let's create some blobs! To do that, create a file with the desired content, and then use

    git hash-object -w <file>

The flag -w means "write", and tells Git to actually write the new blob to the disk.

Create three new blobs!

Tip: You can also use a command like this to create a blob in a single line:

    echo "awesome content" | git hash-object -w --stdin

Did you already notice that you can drag and drop all objects? :)

[setup goal]

echo "Hi" > file1
echo "Ho" > file2
echo "Hu" > file3
git hash-object -w file1
git hash-object -w file2
git hash-object -w file3

BLOB_COUNT=$(git cat-file --batch-check='%(objectname) %(objecttype)' --batch-all-objects | grep blob | wc -l)

test "$BLOB_COUNT" -gt 2
