For this prototype, we assume you have some experience with the command line. Here are some commands that will be useful:

- ls
- echo content > file
- cat file
- mkdir dir

Find the riddle in your current directory and put the answer into the file "answer"!

Omnomnom!

For technical reasons, you can't use `cd` in this prototype yet. But there won't be a lot of interaction with the file system anyways. :)

[setup]

mkdir riddle
echo "ppl p" > riddle/consonants
echo "ae ie" > riddle/vowels

[win]

cat answer | grep -i "apple \\?pie"
