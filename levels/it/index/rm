[description]

If you want to remove a file in the next commit, you can use `git rm`! This will both delete the file locally, and in the index.

If a file is modified, you'll need to reset these changes first/reset the files.

[setup]

echo a > a
echo x > b
echo x > c
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo x > a
echo b > b
git add b

[win]

# Make a commit where all files are deleted ¯\_(^_^)_/¯
test "$(git ls-tree main | wc -l)" -eq 0
