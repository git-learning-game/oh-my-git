[description]

So you've made changes to your files, but you decide that you don't want to keep them! You can use `git checkout` for that!

What happens if you have already update the index, like in file c? You have to reset the index first!

[setup]

echo a > a
echo b > b
echo c > c
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo x > a
echo x > b
echo x > c
git add c

[win]

# Remove all changes in your local files!
test "$(git diff --name-only | wc -l)" -eq 0
