title = Clear the Stash
cards = checkout commit-auto merge reset-hard

[description]

If you want to inspect your stash stack, use the command
    git stash list
    
Oh, you don't want to keep your stashed changes? There are way too many? Then go ahead and clear the stack with
    git stash clear
If you only want to discard a certain stash entry, you can use
    git stash drop <stash>
    
Clear your stash stack!
