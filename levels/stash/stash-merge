[description]

When you want to reapply your changes but you already continued working on your file, you might get
a merge conflict! Let's practise this situation.
Pop the changes from the stash with
    git stash pop
and resolve the merge conflict. Commit the resolved changes and clear the stash stack afterwards.

[setup]

echo "Apple Pie:" > recipe

git add .
git commit -m "creating a recipe"

echo "- 4 Apples" >> recipe

git add .
git commit -m "Adding ingredients"

echo "- 500g Flour" >> recipe

git stash push

echo "- Pinch of Salt" >> recipe

git checkout main
git add recipe

# Did you resolve the conflict and commit?
{ git show HEAD | grep "Flour"; } && { git show HEAD | grep "Salt"; }

# Did you clear stash stack?
test "$(git stash list | wc -l)" -eq 0
