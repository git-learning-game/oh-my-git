Oh no! You have lost your key at some point during the day!

Sure, you could look at every single commit in an attempt to find it - but there's a better way: your time machine has a built-in way to find the point in time where things went wrong quickly!

First, play the "bisect start" card. Then, go to a commit where you don't have the key, and play the "bisect bad" card. Likewise, go to a commit early on where you have the key, and play the "bisect good card".

After you've found the last good commit, reset the main branch to it. What happened to the key after you lost it?

[setup]

echo "You still have your key." > you

for i in {1..60}; do
    if test $i -eq 18; then
        echo "Your pocket is empty." > you
        echo "Is on the ground." > key
    fi
    if test $i -eq 19; then
        echo "Is holding a key in its beak." > bird
        rm key
    fi
    if test $i -eq 20; then
        rm bird
    fi
    git add .
    git commit --allow-empty -m "$i"
done

test "$(git log --pretty=%s main | head -1)" -eq 17

Well done! :) The only problem is that you now have to walk all the way back home, again...
