Here's a sandbox you can play around in.

You can use both the playing cards, as well as the terminal. This is a real Git terminal! Fun things to try:

- Make a commit that merges three timelines together at once!
- Create and delete some tags!
- Make a timeline that's completely independent of the rest!
