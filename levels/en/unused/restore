[description]

You've been working on your essay for a while. But you're not happy with the changes you've made recently. You want to go back to the version called "Best version"!

No problem, you can use the `checkout` card to restore your essay from an older commit!

[setup]

echo "Initial version" > essay.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "Improved version" > essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Improved version"

echo "Best version" > essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Best version"

echo "Less-good version" > essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Less-good version"

[win]

# For nostalgic reasons, restore the very first backup you made!
diff essay.txt <(echo "Best version")
