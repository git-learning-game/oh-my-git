These playing cards are designed to be easy to use and to remember! We'd suggest sticking to them if you don't have a lot of experience with Git!

But there's another way to interact with Git:

Try typing `git init` into the black terminal below, and pressing the enter key!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

[win]

# Initialize the time machine!
test -d .git

Cool! Instead of using the playing cards, you can also do everything via the command line!

The command line is pretty powerful! Often, you can use it to solve tasks faster compared to using a graphical interface.
