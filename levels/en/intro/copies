[description]

This time, you're making a lot of backup copies - you can look at them by clicking on them!

[congrats]

Okay, this kind of works.

But you're a bit worried that you'll end up with hundreds of copies of this form, and it will be hard to keep track of all of them.

And especially when working with other people, sending copies back and forth doesn't seem ideal.

You can't wait to try these time machines!

[setup]

rm -rf .git

echo "~ Why I want to learn Git ~

(I still need to write this.)" >> form.txt


echo "~ Why I want to learn Git ~

- So that I can undo mistakes" >> form2.txt


echo "~ Why I want to learn Git ~

- So that I can undo mistakes
- To track my projects over time" >> form2_final.txt

cp form2_final.txt form2_really_final.txt

[win]

# Add another line to form2_really_final.txt!
test "$(cat form2_really_final.txt | wc -l )" -ge 5
