title = Restore a file from the past
cards = checkout checkout-from commit

[description]

Here's a similar problem: you really liked the essay from the very first commit, and want to have it back! Well, checkout can also restore things from older commits, Here's how:

    git checkout [commit] [file]

[setup]

echo "good version" > essay
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo "bad version" > essay
git commit -am "\"Improve\" essay"

[win]

# Get the first version of your essay, and make a new commit with it.
test "$(git show main:essay)" = "good version"
