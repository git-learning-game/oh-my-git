title = Ignoring files

[description]

That chicken is running around a lot, and changing often. We don't want to have it in our commits.

Add it to the file .gitignore, and try using `git add .`!

[setup]

touch .gitignore
echo important > important
git add important
git commit -m "Initial commit"

[actions]

echo "$RANDOM" > chicken
