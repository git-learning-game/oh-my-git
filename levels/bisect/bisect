Oh no! You have lost your key at some point during the day!

Sure, you could look at every single commit in an attempt to find it - but there's a better way: your time machine has a built-in way to find the point in time where things went wrong quickly!

First, play the "bisect start" card. Then, go to a commit where you don't have the key, and play the "bisect bad" card. Likewise, go to a commit early on where you have the key *in your pocket*, and play the "bisect good" card.

After you've found the last good commit, reset the main branch to it. What happened to the key after you lost it?

[setup]

echo "You still have your key." > you

for i in {1..30}; do
    if test $i -eq 12; then
        echo "Your pocket is empty." > you
        echo "Is on the ground." > key
    fi
    if test $i -eq 13; then
        echo "Is holding a key in its beak." > bird
        rm key
    fi
    if test $i -eq 14; then
        rm bird
    fi
    git add .
    git commit --allow-empty -m "$i"
done

# Find the last good commit
test "$(git log --pretty=%s main | head -1)" -eq 11

Well done! :) The only problem is that you now have to walk all the way back home, again...
