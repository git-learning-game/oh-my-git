[description]

So a tree describes a directory structure at a specific point in time.

It would be nice if we could remember when that state existed, and who authored it, right?

Enter: commits. They are objects that point to a tree and contain some additional metadata. You can create a commit using

    git commit-tree <tree> -m "Description of your commit"

Make a commit from the tree in this repository!

[setup]

touch empty_file
git add .
git write-tree

rm empty_file
git update-index --remove empty_file

[setup goal]

touch empty_file
git add .
git write-tree

rm empty_file
git update-index --remove empty_file

git commit-tree 3185 -m 'Clever commit message'

[win]

COMMIT_COUNT=$(git cat-file --batch-check='%(objectname) %(objecttype)' --batch-all-objects | grep commit | wc -l)

test "$COMMIT_COUNT" -gt 0
