This is prototype #1 for the Git learning game by @bleeptrack and @blinry. Thanks for checking it out! <3

You can interact with the repository labelled "yours" by typing Bash commands in the terminal below! The visualization will show you its internal status.

Let's get started by initializing an empty Git repository in the current directory by typing:

    git init

[congrats]

Well done!

An empty Git repository is... well, quite empty. The only thing that always exists is a reference called "HEAD" - we'll learn what that is later!

But first, let's look at some basics!

(Click "Next Level" as soon as you're ready!)
