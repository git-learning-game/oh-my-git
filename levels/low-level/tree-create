After carefully building the index we want, it would be nice to save a permanent snapshot of it, right?

This is what the second type of objects is for: trees! You can convert the index into a tree using

    git write-tree

Try it! :)

Nice!

Can you make a different tree? Modify the index, then call `git write-tree` again!

[setup]

echo "file 1" > file1
echo "file 2" > file2
echo "file 3" > file3
git add .

[setup goal]

echo "file 1" > file1
echo "file 2" > file2
echo "file 3" > file3
git add .

git write-tree

[win]

git cat-file -p 21a638f28022064c1f1df20844278b494d197979
