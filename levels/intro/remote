Let's add your name to our list of students!

I already have a second commit of it in my time machine - let's work together!

To go back to old commands, you can press arrow up and down. That way, you don't have to type in long commands twice.

[congrats]

Welcome to time travel school! :) I'll see you for your first class tomorrow!

[setup]

echo "~ List of current students ~" > students
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version"
git push -u teacher main

[setup teacher]

git reset --hard main

echo "

- Alex" >> students

git add .
git commit -m "Added two students"
