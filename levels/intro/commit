Again, instead of using the card, you can also type the commands which are printed on it into the black terminal below!

This is totally optional! But this will be a super useful skill in the real world - and it will give you a sparkling golden badge! :)

[setup]

echo "The glass is full of water." > glass

[win]

# commit_win_hint_137
git rev-parse HEAD

# commit_win_hint_138
! test "$(cat glass)" = "The glass is full of water."

# commit_win_hint_139
git rev-parse HEAD^ && ! test "$(git show main:glass)" = "The glass is full of water."
