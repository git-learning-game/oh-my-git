title = Your first commit
cards = commit-auto

[description]

You can use your time machine to make snapshots of objects around you! Here, let's practice this!

(Your teacher pours some water into a glass.)

Again, instead of using the card, you can also type the commands which are printed on it into the black terminal below!

This is totally optional! But this will be a super useful skill in the real world - and it will give you a sparkling golden badge! :)

[setup]

echo "The glass is full of water." > glass

[win]

# Make a snapshot of the glass (a "commit")
git rev-parse HEAD

# Change the contents of the glass!
! test "$(cat glass)" = "The glass is full of water."

# And make a second commit!
git rev-parse HEAD^ && ! test "$(git show main:glass)" = "The glass is full of water."

[congrats]

Nice! You can try making some additional commits. When you feel comfortable, click on "Next Level".
