cards = checkout reflog

[description]

Say you were looking at something in the past, and then switched back to the main branch.

But then, you got reaaally distracted, and after your lunch break, you can't remember which past commit you were on before. How can you find out?

There's a convenient command that shows you all the places your HEAD has pointed to in the past:

    git reflog

[setup]

for i in {1..10}; do
    git commit --allow-empty -m $i
    git branch $i
done
git checkout 3
git checkout main

[win]

# Find out where you've been before, and go back there!
test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git rev-parse 3)"
