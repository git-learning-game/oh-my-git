[description]

Here, both changes happened in one commit! Split them to be in two commits instead.

[setup]

echo something > file1
echo something else > file2
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo this should happen first >> file1
echo and this should happen after that >> file2
git commit -am "Both together"

echo this is some other change >> file1
echo this is some other change >> file2
git commit -am "Something else"

[win]

test "$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r main^)" = "M	file2" &&
test "$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r main~2)" = "M	file1"
