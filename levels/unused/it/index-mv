[description]

Other times, you might want to rename a file in the next commit. Use

    git mv [file] [new name]

for that. The effect is very similar as if you had created a copy with a new name, and removed the old version.

[setup]

echo a > a
echo SPECIAL > b
echo x > c
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo x > a
echo b >> b
git add b

[win]

# Make a commit where you rename the file b to "x".
test "$(git ls-tree --name-only main)" = "$(echo -e "a\nc\nx")"
