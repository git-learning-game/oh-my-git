[description]

Here, you already have two remotes configured! You can list them using `git remote`.

Fetch from both, and look at the suggestions.

Then, make a new commit on top of your original one that introduces a compromise.

[setup]

echo "The bikeshed should be ???" > proposal
git add .
git commit -m "What do you think?"

[setup friend1]

git pull yours main
echo "The bikeshed should be green" > proposal
git commit -am "Green"

[setup friend2]

git pull yours main
echo "The bikeshed should be blue" > proposal
git commit -am "Blue"

[win]

# Your proposal is acceptable for friend1.
git show main:proposal | git grep green
# Your proposal is acceptable for friend2.
git show main:proposal | git grep blue
