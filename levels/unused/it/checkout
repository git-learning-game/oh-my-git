[description]

You've been working on your essay for a while. But - ughh! Now your cat walks over your keyboard and "helps you", so now it's all messed up! :/

But Git is here to help! To discard all changes your cat made, and go back to the version in the last commit, use `checkout`!

[setup]

echo "A" >> essay.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "B" >> essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Improved version"

echo "C" >> essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Even better version"

echo "D" >> essay.txt
git commit -a -m "Marvelous version"

echo "blarg
blaaaargh" > essay.txt

[win]

# Restore the version from the last commit.
cat essay.txt | grep D
