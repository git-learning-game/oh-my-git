[ ] So I don't have to keep copies of all my essays.
[ ] To collaborate with other time travel students.
[ ] Other, please specify:" > form

[actions]

test "$(git config user.name)" != "You" && cat form | grep -v Signature && echo "
Signature: $(git config user.name)" >> form

[win]

# Introduce yourself.
test "$(git config user.name)" != "You"

git show main:form | grep '\[[xX]\]'
