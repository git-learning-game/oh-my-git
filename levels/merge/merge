Here's a trick so that you can sleep a bit longer: just do all your morning activities in parallel universes, and then at the end, merge them together!

[setup]

echo "You do not have a baguette.

You do not have coffee.

You do not have a donut." > you

git add .
git commit -m "The Beginning"

echo "You have a baguette.

You do not have coffee.

You do not have a donut." > you
git add .
git commit -m "You buy a baguette"

echo "You ate a baguette.

You do not have coffee.

You do not have a donut." > you
git add .
git commit -m "You eat the baguette"

git checkout HEAD~2
echo "You do not have a baguette.

You have coffee.

You do not have a donut." > you
git add .
git commit -m "You buy some coffee"

echo "You do not have a baguette.

You drank coffee.

You do not have a donut." > you
git add .
git commit -m "You drink the coffee"

git checkout HEAD~2
echo "You do not have a baguette.

You do not have coffee.

You have a donut." > you
git add .
git commit -m "You buy a donut"

echo "You do not have a baguette.

You do not have coffee.

You ate a donut." > you
git add .
git commit -m "You eat the donut"

git checkout --detach
git branch -D main

[win]

# Build a situation where you consumed a baguette, a coffee, *and* a donut.
{ git show HEAD:you | grep "You ate.*baguette"; } && { git show HEAD:you | grep "You drank.*coffee"; } && { git show HEAD:you | grep "You ate.*donut"; }

# Be on a merge commit.
test "$(git log --pretty=%P -n 1 HEAD | wc -w)" -ge 2

[congrats]

I wonder if you're more relaxed when you *sleep* in parallel timelines...
