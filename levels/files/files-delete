The first day at Time Travel School comes to an end and you receive the key to your room.
Full of excitement you open the door just to find... spider webs! Spider webs everywhere!

Remove all the spider webs you can find with the remove card!

[setup]

echo A tiny spider web is next to your window. > tiny_web
echo A big spider web sticks above your bed. > big_web
echo A cozy bed. > bed
echo An extra thick spider web is right beside your door. > thick_web

[win]

# Remove all spider webs.
! ls | grep thick_web &&
! ls | grep big_web &&
! ls | grep tiny_web

# But make sure you keep your bed!
ls | grep bed

[congrats]

Your room looks now very tidy and cozy! Time to unpack your stuff!
