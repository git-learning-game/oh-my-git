There's a simple command to remove all objects that are not referenced by anything:

    git prune

Remove all blobs in this repository.

[congrats]

Generally, `git prune` will be useful if you want to clean up some objects you made.

Alternatively, you can also click the "Reload" button to restart a level.

[setup]

echo "My master password is a1b2c3d4e5" | git hash-object -w --stdin
echo "This blob really should not exist" | git hash-object -w --stdin
echo "This is a virus" | git hash-object -w --stdin

[setup goal]

[win]

OBJECT_COUNT=$(git cat-file --batch-check='%(objectname) %(objecttype)' --batch-all-objects | wc -l)

test "$OBJECT_COUNT" -eq 0
