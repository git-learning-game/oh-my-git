Actually, you decide that you don't need any sleep.

Because of that, you won't require a bed, and can build some other piece of furniture from the wood!


[setup]

echo A yellow cupboard with lots of drawers. > cupboard
echo A really big yellow shelf. > shelf
echo A comfortable, yellow bed with yellow cushions. > bed

[win]

# Rename the bed into something else, and give it a new description!
NUM_FILES="$(ls | wc -l)"
! test -f bed && test "$NUM_FILES" -ge 3 && ! grep -r "yellow bed" .

[congrats]

Neat! It even still looks a bit comfortable!

You head out, eager for your first lesson at time travel school!
