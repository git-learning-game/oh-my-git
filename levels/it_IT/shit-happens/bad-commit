title = Undo a bad commit
cards = reset commit-a

[description]

Oh no, we made a bad commit! How can we undo making the commit, and go back to a point where we can try again?

The answer is using `git reset [commit]`, which does two things:

- It resets the current branch ref to the commit you specify.
- And it resets the index to that commit.

It does not change your working directory in any way, which means that after that, you can try making the commit you want again.

[setup]

echo "1 2 3 4" > numbers
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11" > numbers
git commit -am "More numberrrrrs"

[win]

# In the last main commit, the numbers file contains the numbers from 1 to 10.
test "$(git show main:numbers)" = "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
# The commit message of that commit is "More numbers".
git log -1 --oneline | grep "More numbers"
# The commit with the typo is not part of the main branch anymore.
git log --oneline | grep -v "rrrrr"
