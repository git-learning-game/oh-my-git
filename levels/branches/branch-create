Branches also make it really easy to travel between different places using the command line! As soon as you have a branch called "birthday", you can type `git checkout birthday` to travel to it!

[setup]

echo "You wrap the birthday present, and grab your concert ticket." > you
git add .
git commit -m "Evening preparations"
echo "You go to the birthday party!" >> you
git add .
git commit -m "Go to the birthday"

git checkout HEAD~1
echo "You go to the concert!" > you
git add .
git commit -m "Go to the concert"

git checkout HEAD~1

git branch -D main

[win]

# branchcreate_win_hint_092
git show birthday | grep 'to the birthday'

# branchcreate_win_hint_093
git show concert | grep 'to the concert'
