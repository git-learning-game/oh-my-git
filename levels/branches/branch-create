[description]

You were invited to two parties! At one of them, your favorite band is playing - and the other one is your best friend's birthday party. Where should you go? No worries - as a time travel agent in training, you can go to both parties!

To make it easier to tell which timeline is which, you can create time portals! (We call these "branches".)

[setup]

echo "You wrap the birthday present, and grab your concert ticket." > you
git add .
git commit -m "Evening preparations"
echo "You go to the birthday party!" >> you
git add .
git commit -m "Go to the birthday"

git checkout HEAD~1
echo "You go to the concert!" > you
git add .
git commit -m "Go to the concert"

git checkout HEAD~1

git branch -D main

[win]

# Create a branch called 'birthday' that points to the birthday timeline.
git show birthday | grep 'to the birthday'

# Create a branch called 'concert' that points to the concert timeline.
git show concert | grep 'to the concert'

[congrats]

Now you can travel between those branches easily (using `git checkout`) - try it!

Your friend is happy that you made it to the birthday party and you also got your concert ticket signed. Yay!
