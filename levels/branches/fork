The blue animal represents a concept known as the "HEAD pointer" in Git: It shows you which commit is the current one.

Here's a cool trick to go to the previous commit: 

    git checkout HEAD^

You can also go back two commits by typing, for example: 

    git checkout HEAD~2

[setup]

mkdir cage
echo "Looks very hungry." > cage/lion

echo "A small child.
It really loves cats!" > child
git add .
git commit -m "The beginning"

echo "It's holding a lollipop." >> child
git commit -am "The child buys something"

mv child cage
git add .
git commit -m "The child climbs somewhere"

git rm cage/child
echo "Looks happy. :)" > cage/lion
git add .
git commit -m "Oh no"

echo "It's sleeping." > cage/lion
git add .
git commit -m "Nap time!"

git checkout --detach
git branch -d main

[win]

# fork_win_hint_106
git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD | grep child

# fork_win_hint_107
git show HEAD:cage/lion | grep -v "very hungry"
