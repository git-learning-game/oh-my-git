[description]

Note that there are two options to "travel to the end of a timeline":

First, you can directly travel to the commit, like we've done it before.

And second, you can travel to the branch label. In this case, when you make a new commit, the branch will grow with you, and still point at the end of the timeline, which is usually what we want!

Let's try both of these!

[setup]

echo "You wrap the birthday present, and grab your concert ticket." > you
git add .
git commit -m "Evening preparations"
echo "You go to the birthday party!" >> you
git add .
git commit -m "Go to the birthday"
git branch birthday

git checkout HEAD~1
echo "You go to the concert!" > you
git add .
git commit -m "Go to the concert"
git branch concert

git checkout HEAD~1

git branch -D main

[win]

# Travel directly to the last commit of the birthday timeline, make a change to 'you', and make a commit
for commit in $(git cat-file --batch-check='%(objectname) %(objecttype)' --batch-all-objects | grep 'commit$' | cut -f1 -d' '); do
    if test $(git rev-parse $commit^) = $(git rev-parse birthday); then
        return 0
    fi
done
return 1

# Travel to the 'concert' branch, make a change to 'you', and a commit.
git show concert^ | grep "Go to the concert"
