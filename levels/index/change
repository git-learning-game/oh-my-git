[setup]

echo "The candle is burning with a blue flame." > candle
git add .
git commit -m "The beginning"

# Make a change to the candle.
test "$(git diff --name-only)" = "candle" || file -f .git/candle-changed && touch .git/candle-changed

test "$(git diff --cached --name-only)" = "candle" || file -f .git/candle-added && touch .git/candle-added

# new_win_hint_084
